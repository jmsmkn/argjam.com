## What should I wear?

We’ll be taking the occasion to get dressed up (probably wearing what we wore in the Dutch ceremony), and guests are encouraged to as well. It might be hot, so dress appropriately and make sure you’re comfortable enough to dance in the July heat. 

## What will I eat?

We won’t be having a formal, seated dinner, but we’ve hired out El Corazon for the evening. They’ll provide tacos, burritos, rice and beans, etc. to keep everyone sated. We’re thrilled that our friend and baker extraordinaire Margaret Morris will be making a wedding cake for us.

When you R.S.V.P., there will be questions about the dietary preferences and restrictions of you and your guest. This will help us get a sense of what we should have El Corazon serving. 

## What time does the party start and end?

The party starts at 7pm. Because of Rising Tide’s hours of operation (as a tasting room not a bar), we have to be entirely off the premises by 11 pm, which means the party will end around 10.30. We can always carry on at a bar that’s open later. 

## What if I don’t drink beer?

Wine will also be available, and there will be plenty of non-alcoholic beverages for those who are not drinking.

## What music will there be?

Good question. We’ll make a spotify playlist ahead of time, and we’re open to your suggestions (in the RSVP form).

## Who’s James?

James is Andrea’s future husband. He’s British. This party is James’s response to the suggestion that he couldn’t run a piss up in a brewery. You can ask him what that means in July. 

## What do I do now?

Let us know you’re coming by filling out the R.S.V.P form here!

## Can I bring a guest?

Yes! Just let us know when you R.S.V.P.
