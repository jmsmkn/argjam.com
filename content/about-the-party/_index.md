**We’ve rented out [Rising Tide Brewing Company](https://www.risingtidebrewing.com/visit/) for the evening of Saturday, 14 July for our stateside party.**

Rising Tide is one of our favorite Portland breweries, and they have a great tasting room with indoor and outdoor space in downtown Portland. 

Because things will be a little more casual than other wedding parties, we won’t be serving a sit down dinner, but we’ve hired out El Corazon’s food truck for the evening to keep everyone fed. We’ll also have wedding cake, probably a few toasts and speeches, and dancing. 

Beer will be provided by Rising Tide, wine will be available for those who prefer, as well as non-alcoholic drinks for those who wish to abstain and for those who are driving. All guests are strictly prohibited from bringing in any alcohol. Don’t worry, there will be plenty.

We’ll be dressed up and encourage you to as well, but feel free to wear whatever you’re comfortable in.

You are welcome to bring a guest. Families are welcome.

Some parking is available - [here’s Rising Tide’s parking map](http://www.risingtidebrewing.com/parking-map). If you are coming by car and plan to drink, please plan to have a designated driver for the evening. We’ll provide plenty to drink that’s non-alcoholic as well.

## RSVP

**[R.S.V.P. online](/rsvp) (for you and your guest) by 1 May 2018.** We’ll also be taking note of food allergies, and we’ll try to build the food truck menu around them.
