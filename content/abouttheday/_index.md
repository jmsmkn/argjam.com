# The reception
The wedding reception will be held at Karel 1, the museum cafe of the Van AbbeMuseum of Modern and Contemporary Art in Eindhoven. 

Please join us at 17.00 on Friday, 22 June 2018 for dinner, toasts, and dancing. 

Details will follow; please [RSVP here](/rsvp) so we can be in contact, and this page will be updated with additional information in the coming weeks. 

# How do I get to Karel 1? 
Karel 1 and the Van AbbeMuseum are in the center of Eindhoven at Stratumsedijk 2. From the train station, it’s a 20 minute walk. Several busses depart from the train station.

# What should I wear?
The Netherlands gets lots of rain all year round; June is no exception. We’d advise bringing a rain jacket or umbrella for getting to and from the museum, but the reception will be indoors. Cocktail attire suggested, but wear clothes and shoes you can dance in!
