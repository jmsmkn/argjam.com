<!--more-->
Andrea and James both moved to the Netherlands in 2013; Andrea, from the US, to begin a PhD in the city of Nijmegen, and James, just having finished his in England, to take a job with Philips in the city of Eindhoven. A few months after their respective arrivals, they met at an Alasdair Roberts gig. They’ve been together ever since. 

In June 2018, Andrea and James, now residents of Nijmegen, will be married in the historic Nijmegen Stadhuis. They’ll celebrate their wedding with a reception in Eindhoven and then again with another party in Portland, Maine (USA) in July.
